# cqrs-example
The application presents a simple use of the ``CQRS`` pattern on the example of product service. The main idea of ``CQRS`` is to separate the write model from the read model.

## Setup
You must have a ``mongo`` database to run it. Fortunately, we have a ``docker`` so all you have to do is run the command
```
docker-compose up -d
```
